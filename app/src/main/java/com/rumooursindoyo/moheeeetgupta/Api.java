 *  Retrofit in android :- it is type-safe REST client for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services.

 *  It manages the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses.
 *  It alternates IP addresses if there is a connection to a web service failure.
